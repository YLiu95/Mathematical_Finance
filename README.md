# Apply Stochastic Processes in Finance

## Topics include:

✓ Stochastic processes

✓ Markov chain

✓ Martingale

✓ Optional stopping theorem

✓ Brownian motion

## **Highlights:**

## 1. Markov chain:

Simulate the evolution of the stock price over 1000 time steps with an initial price of 100.

## 2. Martingale:

Simulate this game of Martingale and plot the investment and bet size history over the course of the game.

## 3. Optional stopping theorem:

Plot the evolution of the gold price and the average gold price over the 1000 days simulation period.

## 4. Brownian motion:

Suppose a stock's initial price is $100, and the stock follows a Brownian motion with a drift of 0.01 and a standard deviation of 0.1. Simulate the stock price over 1000 time steps using Python code.

# Cpp and Financial Engineering

Run C++ in Jupyter Notebook and apply C++ to financial engineering

## C++ key concepts: 

✓ data encapsulation 

✓ class inheritance 

✓ polymorphism 

✓ operator overloading 

✓ memory management 

✓ namespaces 

✓ exception handling


## Applications to financial engineering: 

✓ binomial method for option pricing

✓ Black-Scholes model for option pricing
